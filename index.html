        <h2>What is Data Science</h2>
        <p>Data science is the study of data.
           It involves developing methods of recording, storing, and analyzing data to effectively extract useful information.
           The goal of data science is to gain insights and knowledge from any type of data both structured and unstructured.</p>

        <h3>What is a Software Engineer?</h3>
        <p>
          Software engineering is a branch of computer science which includes the development 
          and building of computer systems software and applications software. 
          Computer systems software is composed of programs that include computing utilities and operations systems. 
          Applications software consists of user-focused programs that include web browsers, database programs, etc.
        </p>
        <h3>Computer hardware</h3>
        <p>
          Computer hardware includes the physical parts of a computer, such as the case, 
          central processing unit (CPU), monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data storage, graphics card, 
          sound card, speakers and motherboard. By contrast, software is the set of instructions that 
          can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, 
          whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.

             <h3>Data analysis</h3>
             <p>
              Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, 
              and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, 
              informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. 
              Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, 
              and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. 
              In today's business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions 
              more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively.

             <h3>Machine learning</h3>
             <p>
               Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically 
               through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. 
               Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", 
               in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. 
               Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as in medicine, 
               email filtering, and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms 
               to perform the needed tasks.

             <h3>Cybersecurity Data Analysis</h3>
             <p>
              Computer security, cybersecurity or information technology security (IT security) is the protection 
              of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, 
              or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
              The field is becoming increasingly significant due to the increased reliance on computer systems, 
              the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, 
              and due to the growth of "smart" devices, including smartphones, televisions, 
              and the various devices that constitute the "Internet of things". 
              Owing to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, 
              cybersecurity is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.
